            The Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) was founded in 1929 by Maria Montessori to maintain the integrity of her lifeâ€™s work and to ensure that it would be perpetuated after her death. AMI is the recognised international authority for Montessori education. During its long history AMI has fostered the growth and development of Montessori programmes and teacher training, along with supporting the development and education of children and young adults in a vast variety of settings throughout the world.
